# hello-world
# This is my first time making a repository on GitHub. Repositories are used to organise a single project.

# The 'Master' branch is the main branch of the project. This is the branch with the end result of the project on. You use other branches to experiment and make edits before merging them with the the master branch (i.e. you experiment and write new lines of code in other branches and then pull them into the final Master branch). For instance, your Master branch could be 'webscraper-twitter' and another branch could be 'webscraper-twitter-edits'.

# Remember, separate branches will clone the Master branch when first created. You can edit them to include different code and save either to the branch or merge them with the Master branch

# Saved changes in Github are called commits. Each commit has a commit message which explains the changes made.
